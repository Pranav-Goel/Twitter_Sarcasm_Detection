This is an implementation of the research - "Harnessing Incongruity for Sarcasm Detection" by Joshi et al (2015). The pdf file of this paper is included.

This project classifies twitter tweets as sarcastic or non sarcastic based on the features described in mentioned research.
This project was undertaken under guidance of Dr. AK Singh, in semester 4, at IIT (BHU), Varanasi by Pranav Goel and Prayas Jain.

The project report gives a detailed account of what has been done, and how, covering all the efforts, discussing the results as well as the future directions.
The powerpoint presentation serves as a brief, presentable summary of this report.

NOTE: the final implementation , or the file which when run would produce the results, is in further-final\libsvm-3.21\python ; fine name - try.py

The final results - 

(with all features)
Precision - 0.7216
Recall - 0.9345
F-score - 0.8144

Following supporting codes and data files are in supporting-files folder, and are presented here in the order of implementation:

 order - 
get_tweets.py		twitter streaming to get tweets
json-read2.py			json file cleanup and appending , repalcing with NAME , HYPERLINK ,etc.
the 2 json files in 	the streamed original tweets form
dup-rem 			remove duplicate json and write to a text file
text-dup-rem 			remove retweets
text-append  			to append two files txt
hashtag-rem.py 			to remove hashtags

cleaned up tweets - (in )
pranav+old+final - 2353 sarcastic tweets
NS-final         - 1400 non-sarcastic tweets

run sentistrength tool
originally created files : 
pranav+old+final+results

we cleaned them up, to create the files we use -
pranav+old+final+results-clean.txt
NS+final+results-clean.txt

To generate the features - feature-gen.py and try1-emojis.py
 original csv files (without unigrams) 

For unigrams - 
create_dic.py
vocab.txt
FINAL-feature-gen.py 	This also creates the data in libsvm format

 the libsvm formatted files - 
ns-lib2
sarc-libsvm
libsvm_data 2  		3753 tweets data in proper libsvm format


ABOVE ALL IN  FOLDER


To  the final results on data go to D:\exp-proj\twitter2\further-final\libsvm-3.21\python
and run try.py there
